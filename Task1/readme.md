Note: Windows users can use Ctrl+Shift+C on a file to directly copy its path, this can be pasted anywhere in the program
#### Page Range
Whenever you want to select all pages from 20 to 30, no need to individually mention all page number, just input 20-30
Both page number 20 and 30 are included

#### Pypdf
The pypdf module is used for most of the functions like merge, split, add bookmark, scale pages, etc

#### Spire.pdf
Since pypdf cannot edit or delete pdf's, spire.pdf is used for these 2 cases
ALso due better compression algorithm that pypdf, even the compress pdf function uses spire.pdf
